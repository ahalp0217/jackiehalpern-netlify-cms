T﻿o begin, I want to thank my son Andrew for creating this colorful website, that I hope will inspire others to learn how to **quilt** or take an interest in the many **quilts** that blanket our world.  In honor of those hours he dedicated to building this website, I share his portrait I **quilted** just a few years ago. This **quilt** is based on an actual photo I took of Andrew while he tried on a hat in a store we visited in California.

T﻿his blog will be dedicated to all things related to **quilts.**  M﻿ost of the **quilts** that I sew are made for family members, friends and for myself. I enjoy making t-shirt quilts, art quilts, and especially pet portrait quilts.  

N﻿ext time, I will share my love for visiting the Houston International **Quilt** Festival. Thanks to my dear friend, Gail, who inspired me to discover this wonderful, insanely huge extravaganza. I fly from New York to Houston each year, meet up with many friends and am in awe of the all the quilts and vendors at the show.
